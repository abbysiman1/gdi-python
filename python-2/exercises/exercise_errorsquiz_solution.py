Question 1:
Valter wrote a procedure to display the first value in a list of numbers. He tested it with a few lists, and each time, it returned the correct answer. However, when Valter tested it with an empty list, he got an error.

What type of error best describes the error in Valter's procedure?
a. Round-off error
b. Syntax error
c. Run-time error

Question 4:
Akinyi wrote a computer program to determine the smallest number in a given list. When testing it, she found that it returned the correct answer when all of the numbers were positive, but returned 0 when any of the numbers were negative.

Question 5:
Which of the following situations could describe a program with a syntax error?
a. A software engineer wrote a program to determine if a number is even. When tested with an even number, it incorrectly returned false.
b. A software engineer wrote a program to convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius. When tested, it always returned the converted temperature rounded to the nearest integer.
c. A software engineer wrote a program to reverse a string. When tested, the program would not execute.
d. A software engineer wrote a program to display each of the strings in a list. When tested, it displayed each of the strings before crashing with an error.
